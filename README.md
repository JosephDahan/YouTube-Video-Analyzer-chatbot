### Documentation

#### Overview

This script creates a Streamlit web application that allows users to input a YouTube video URL and get a summary of the video's content generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. The application also supports asking questions about the video content.

#### Dependencies

- `streamlit`
- `youtube_transcript_api`
- `requests`
- `urllib`

#### Functions

##### `extract_video_id(url: str) -> str or None`

This function takes a YouTube URL as input and extracts the video ID from it. It supports both standard YouTube URLs and shortened "youtu.be" URLs.

#### Streamlit Application

The Streamlit application has several sections:

1. **API Key Configuration**: Sidebar section where users can input their OpenAI API key.
2. **New Chat Button**: A button in the sidebar to start a new chat session.
3. **ChatGPT-like clone with YouTube Video Analyzer**: The main title of the application.
4. **Chat Interface**: An interface where the chat between the user and the assistant is displayed.
5. **YouTube Video URL Input**: A chat input where users can input the YouTube video URL they want to analyze.

#### Workflow

1. **Session State Initialization**: Initializes session state variables to manage the application state across reruns.
2. **New Chat Button**: Resets the session state variables when clicked, essentially starting a new chat session.
3. **API Key Configuration**: Allows users to input their OpenAI API key to use the application.
4. **YouTube Video URL Input**:
   - Users input a YouTube video URL.
   - The script extracts the video ID using `extract_video_id`.
   - Fetches the video details and transcript using `pytube` and `YouTubeTranscriptApi`.
   - If the transcript is successfully fetched, it generates a summary using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo.
5. **Chat Interface**:
   - Displays the chat history.
   - Allows users to ask questions about the video content.
   - Generates responses to user questions using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo based on the video transcript and details.
